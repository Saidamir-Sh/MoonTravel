          <h1>TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
          <p>Understanding how an experimental payload will respond to the conditions of space is crucial to a researcher's ability to confirm designs or make necessary adjustments before progressing to more costly orbital deployments. To do so, scientists often use a modified airplane that achieves periods of variable gravity through a series of maneuvers called parabolas.</p>
